🎮 Valorant Comp Roller

A lightweight web application that generates randomized competitive Valorant team compositions.

Instead of defaulting to the same meta agents every game, this app helps players experiment with new team strategies and combinations.

🚀 Overview

Valorant Comp Roller is a front-end web application that dynamically generates random team compositions for ranked or competitive play.

This project was built to:

Practice real-world full-stack development workflow

Strengthen JavaScript logic and state management

Implement clean component structure

Deploy a production-ready application using Vercel

🛠 Tech Stack

JavaScript

Component-based architecture

Responsive UI design

Deployment

Vercel (production hosting & CI/CD integration)

Version Control

Git

GitHub

⚙️ Features

🎲 Randomized 5-agent team generation

🔁 Re-roll functionality

📱 Responsive design

⚡ Fast static deployment

🧠 How It Works

The application:

Stores a predefined list of Valorant agents.

Randomly selects agents while preventing duplicates.

Dynamically renders the generated team composition to the UI.

Allows users to re-roll compositions instantly.

The focus was clean logic flow and separation of concerns between UI rendering and generation logic.

🎯 Why I Built This

As an aspiring full-stack engineer, I focus on building projects that:

Demonstrate applied logic

Show deployment capability

Move beyond tutorial-based code

Emphasize shipping working software

This project represents ownership from idea → build → deploy.

📌 Future Improvements

Agent role filters (Duelist, Initiator, Controller, Sentinel)

Map-specific composition logic

Save/share comp functionality

Backend integration for tracking comp usage
